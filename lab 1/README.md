CSE 124/224 Spring 2025 Lab 1 Starter Code

This repository contains the utilities that you'll use for lab 1.  The
utilities are provided in binary form for a few common systems/architectures.

## Building

To build your sort program:

$ go build -o bin/sort src/sort.go


## Submission

Your submission should include your code in the `src` directory (and
should be able to be built with the above command)

You should include a file called report.pdf that has the runtime plot
described in the lab spec.

## Checklist

* Your sort implementation in src/sort.go
* A lab report in report.pdf (stored in the base directory)
